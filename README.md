##  Notes

- The materials and programming language used are based on my personal preferences for better learning and comfort.

- However, the core content—including videos, contests, and practice problems—is mandatory and must be completed as part of the training schedule.

- The listed deadlines are estimated for someone fully focused on this training.
- If they don’t match your pace, you can set your own realistic deadlines — the important thing is consistency and completion.
